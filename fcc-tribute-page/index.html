<h2>Powers</h2>
<ul>
  <li><b>Soul sucking:</b> Marceline stated the only power her demon heritage granted her was the ability to suck souls, like her father. This allowed her to gain the specific abilities of vampires she had killed. She can also suck out still living souls.</li>
  <li><b>Levitation:</b> She has the ability to float and even to fly with careful control and rapid speed. She can even sleep while floating.</li>
  <li><b>Pyrokinesis:</b> She can light fire with only her mind.</li>
  <li><b>Telekinesis:</b> She can move things using her mind.</li>
  <li><b>Invisibility:</b> She can turn invisible.</li>
  <li><b>Necromancy:</b> She can raise spooky scary skeletons. </li>
  <li><b>Rapid healing:</b> She appears to heal quickly from injuries, at least damage from sunlight.</li>
  <li><b>Shape-shifting:</b> She has the ability to shape-shift into numerous monstrous forms, including a bat, a wolf, a reptilian creature, and a large tentacled monster. </li>
  <li><b>Eating shades of red:</b> Unlike traditional vampires, Marceline is capable of sustaining herself on "shades of red," such as the color in strawberries, rather than being limited to surviving on blood. </li>
  <li><b>The Nightosphere amulet:</b> When worn she gains the ability to shoot green lasers which either vaporize or transform whatever they hit. She can also create or transform into a large cloud of blood mist with the ability to shoot green lasers.</li>
  <li><b>Communication with absorbed beings:</b> As a result of absorbing the Vampire King's dark cloud half, she can now communicate with a miniature mental projection of the Vampire King.</li>
  <li><b>Stylish Magic Clothing:</b> Whenever she shape-shifts into a larger form, her clothes either grow with her, or are torn apart explosively. At times she appears to be able to preserve her clothing, even after changing into large forms that would cause it to break: in many appearances, the clothing disappears until she returns to her humanoid form. In either case, her duds always reappear when she reverts to her normal form.</li>
</ul>
 
<h2>Abilities</h2>
<ol>
  <li><b>Bass player:</b> She is an expert bass player.</li>
  <li><b>Singer:</b> She is a proficient singer.</li>
  <li><b>Basketball player:</b> She can play basketball and perform a slam dunk without floating.</li>
  <li><b>Warrioress:</b> Marceline is a mighty fighter, able to use all of her abilities strategically to great affect. She is certainly one of the most formidable beings currently on Ooo.</li>
</ol>
